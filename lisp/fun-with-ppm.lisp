; Q: Dafuq is a PPM?
; A: It's a super simple image format.
;
; See http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html
;
; For example, a PPM of: BLACK WHITE
;                        WHITE BLACK
;
; Would look like:
;
; +----coolimage.ppm----+
; | P3                  | 
; | 2 2                 |
; | 16                  |
; | 0  0  0   15 15 15  |
; | 15 15 15  0  0  0   |
