    "1. Pick two prime numbers, call them $p$ and $q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   These are the so-called 'prime factors' that satisfy $n = pq$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Let's use $p = 3$ and $q = 11$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $p = 3, q = 11$\n",
    "   \n",
    "  \n",

    "   $n = (3 * 11) = 33$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $n = 33$\n",
    "   \n",

    "   Choose a prime number $e$ such that $totient(n)$ is not divisible by $e$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Since $totient(n) = 20$, we can choose numbers like $7, 11, 13, 17, 19$, etc.\n",
