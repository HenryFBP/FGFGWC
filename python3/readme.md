# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS (Sorry):

## Q:  Why are there setup instructions?! Isn't this supposed to be simple?!

A: 	I have a crapload of dependencies you need to have to run some of these
examples. Sorry.

## Tell me already!

1. 	Install Python >=3.6
2.	In this directory, run `pip install pipenv`.
3.  In this directory, run `pipenv install`.
	- This will install all required deps from a file called `Pipfile`.
	- Feel free to open `Pipfile` to see what goofy libs I'm forcing you to 
		download.
4. 	To run a python script PROPERLY, use `pipenv run python myfile.py`.
5.	???
6. 	profit
