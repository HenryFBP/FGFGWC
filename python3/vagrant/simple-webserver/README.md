# What do I need?

Standard hardware requisites for using Virtualization apply - read up if you're
unsure (or find out when it's too late ;) )

Go ahead and download and install
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

# How do I run this example?

In terminal, type `vagrant up` and then check out the URL `127.0.0.1:5000` with your web browser :)
